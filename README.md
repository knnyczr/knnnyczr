# Kenneth Cruz

Software engineer with a proven ability to efficiently lead and mentor teams composed of people with varying skill levels and finding the best use of their talents. Prior to becoming a software engineer, I simultaneously held 3 leadership positions, creative director for a university newspaper, VP of LGBTA, and a shift supervisor at Starbucks. In holding these positions, I demonstrated my leadership and organizational strength when managing teams. As a life-long learner myself, I completed 1000+ hours of bootcamp structure following a 4-year BS degree in graphic design. Since making my transition to software engineer, I’ve mentored 300+ students to become proficient in full-stack applications using scrum methodology. I am now excited to apply these strengths on a talented, collaborative software development team to design and deliver quality front-end applications.
